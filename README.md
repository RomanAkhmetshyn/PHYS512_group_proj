**Initial Plan:
Our plan is to simulate exoplanet transits/transit timing variations.

The general outline would be as follows:
1.⁠ simulate orbital dynamics of system w/ one planet around a Star; generate transit data and use mcmc to get best-fit parameters

2.⁠ ⁠Perturbation of lightcurve: introduce additional planet(s) and see what we can learn about the properties about the planet(s) in the system using mcmc (aka TTV)**
